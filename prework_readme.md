## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Change party size to divide bill amongst multiple party members.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It has been a minute since I have played around with UIKit, I have been studying SwiftUI lately, but I forget how much more flexibility you have with UIKit. I really enjoy learning swift, it comes quickly, just need more time and occasional guidance to grow my knowledge.
